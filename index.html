        <p>Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan\u2013ATLAS) is growing brighter in planet Earth's sky. Fondly known as comet A3,
          this new visitor to the inner Solar System is traveling from the distant Oort cloud. The comet reached
          perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, on September 27 and will reach perigee, its closest to our fair
          planet, on October 12, by then becoming an evening sky apparition. But comet A3 was an early morning riser on
          September 30 when this image was made. Its bright coma and already long tail share a pre-dawn skyscape from
          Praia Grande, Santa Catarina in southern Brazil with the waning crescent Moon just peeking above the eastern
          horizon. While the behaviour of comets is notoriously unpredictable, Tsuchinshan\u2013ATLAS could become a
          comet
          visually rivaling C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE). Comet NEOWISE wowed skygazers in the summer of 2020. Growing Gallery:
